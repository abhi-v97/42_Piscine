## Exercise 06: ft_print_comb2

By adding '0' to a single digit i, we get the ascii value of the number, allowing us to print a number to std out.

To split the number 42 into 4 and 2, we can use the following trick:
- 42 / 10 = 4 : this is due to integers being rounded down in C (floor, in math terms)
- 42 % 10 = 2 : the remainder of 42 / 10 is 2, so the modulus is 2

To compile, uncomment the main and use:
> cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_putchar.c
