## Exercise 05: ft_print_comb

To complete this exercise, we define three variables a, b, and c of int type, each representing a digit to be printed.

a starts at zero, and there can not be repeat digits so b starts at 1 and c starts at 2.

Likewise, c ends at 9, so b ends at 8 and a ends at 7. 

The final number will always be 789, and its the only one where a = 7, so this is how I write a comma for every number except the final one.

To compile, uncomment the main and use:
> cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_print_comb.c
