## Exercise 00: ft_putchar

**#include <unistd.h>:** this attaches the library file 'unistd.h' which gives us access to the write function.

Prototype:
'void' means the ouput is null, void.
'char c' indicates the input parameter of the function is a variable of type char (character).

The write function has three parameters: `write (int fd, void *buf, size_t n)`;
- 'fd' is the file descriptor, used to tell which file to write to.
- in Linux, everything is a file, even terminal input and output.
- The standard file descriptors are: 0 for standard input, 1 for standard output, 2 for standard error.
- 'buf' is a pointer to a buffer of at least n bytes which will be written to the file.
- 'n' is the number of bytes to write, if smaller than the buffer the output is truncated.

To compile, uncomment the main and use:
> cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_putchar.c
