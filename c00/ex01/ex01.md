## Exercise 01: ft_print_alphabet

Prototype: the output and input of this function is void, it simply performs the same task each time it is called.

This function can be coded in many ways, you can manually type out the alphabet and output it as a string.

The character in single quotes refers to the ascii value of 'a' (man ascii), this value is what will be interpreted by the computer.

The while loop takes action while a condition is true. So while the char c is less than or equal to 'z', it will print the alphabet one by one.

To compile, uncomment the main and use:
> cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_print_alphabet.c
