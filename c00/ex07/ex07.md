## Exercise 07: ft_putnbr.c

To print a string of numbers, we use recursion to break the number into single digits.

How it works:
- if nb is single digit, print it directly. This is also the 'break' condition or base case for recursion, where recursion stops.
- if nb has more than one digit, the function calls itself twice:
- 1. ft_putnbr(nb / 10): removes the last digit and calls the function again
- 2. ft_putnbr(nb % 10): prints the last digit
- Finally, we make a special case for INT_MIN, to prevent overflow as we cannot represent its positive value as an int.
- If you try to do nb = -nb, it will overflow as 2147483648 cannot be represented as an int.

To compile, uncomment the main and use:
