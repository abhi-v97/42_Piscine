## Exercise 08: ft_print_combn.c

Couldn't do this exercise during the Piscine, came back to it much later and found it pretty easy...

First, you print the first valid number, so for n = 4 you print 0123.
Then, you find the first number you can increment from the right and increment it
Then you set all numbers to its right in ascending order
If output[0] == 10 - n, you've printed the last number: eg for n = 3 the last number is 789, and the only number that starts with 7
You also check for output[0] > 9 which is for the n = 1 edge case. There's probably a smarter way of doing this check

To compile, uncomment the main and use:
> cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_putchar.c
