 ## Exercise 02: ft_print_reverse_alphabet

Prototype: the output and input of this function is void, it simply performs the same task each time it is called.

Using the same logic as the previous exercise, but in reverse: you start at 'z' and keep printing until you are below 'a'.

To compile, uncomment the main and use:
> cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c
